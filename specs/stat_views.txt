View Name	Description

pg_stat_activity	One row per server process, showing database OID, database name, process ID, user OID, user name, application name, client's address, host name (if available), and port number, times at which the server process, current transaction, and current query began execution, process's waiting status, and text of the current query. The columns that report data on the current query are available unless the parameter track_activities has been turned off. Furthermore, these columns are only visible if the user examining the view is a superuser or the same as the user owning the process being reported on. The client's host name will be available only if log_hostname is set or if the user's host name needed to be looked up during pg_hba.conf processing.

pg_stat_bgwriter	One row only, showing cluster-wide statistics from the background writer: number of scheduled checkpoints, requested checkpoints, buffers written by checkpoints and cleaning scans, and the number of times the background writer stopped a cleaning scan because it had written too many buffers. Also includes statistics about the shared buffer pool, including buffers written by backends (that is, not by the background writer), how many times those backends had to execute their own fsync calls (normally the background writer handles those even when the backend does its own write), total buffers allocated, and time of last statistics reset.

pg_stat_database	One row per database, showing database OID, database name, number of active server processes connected to that database, number of transactions committed and rolled back in that database, total disk blocks read, total buffer hits (i.e., block read requests avoided by finding the block already in buffer cache), number of rows returned, fetched, inserted, updated and deleted, the total number of queries canceled due to conflict with recovery (on standby servers), and time of last statistics reset.

pg_stat_database_conflicts	One row per database, showing database OID, database name and the number of queries that have been canceled in this database due to dropped tablespaces, lock timeouts, old snapshots, pinned buffers and deadlocks. Will only contain information on standby servers, since conflicts do not occur on master servers.

pg_stat_replication	One row per WAL sender process, showing process ID, user OID, user name, application name, client's address, host name (if available) and port number, time at which the server process began execution, and the current WAL sender state and transaction log location. In addition, the standby reports the last transaction log position it received and wrote, the last position it flushed to disk, and the last position it replayed, and this information is also displayed here. If the standby's application names matches one of the settings in synchronous_standby_names then the sync_priority is shown here also, that is the order in which standbys will become the synchronous standby. The columns detailing what exactly the connection is doing are only visible if the user examining the view is a superuser. The client's host name will be available only if log_hostname is set or if the user's host name needed to be looked up during pg_hba.conf processing. Only directly connected standbys are listed; no information about downstream standby servers is recorded.

pg_stat_all_tables	For each table in the current database (including TOAST tables), the table OID, schema and table name, number of sequential scans initiated, number of live rows fetched by sequential scans, number of index scans initiated (over all indexes belonging to the table), number of live rows fetched by index scans, numbers of row insertions, updates, and deletions, number of row updates that were HOT (i.e., no separate index update), numbers of live and dead rows, the last time the table was non-FULL vacuumed manually, the last time it was vacuumed by the autovacuum daemon, the last time it was analyzed manually, the last time it was analyzed by the autovacuum daemon, number of times it has been non-FULL vacuumed manually, number of times it has been vacuumed by the autovacuum daemon, number of times it has been analyzed manually, and the number of times it has been analyzed by the autovacuum daemon.

pg_stat_sys_tables	Same as pg_stat_all_tables, except that only system tables are shown.

pg_stat_user_tables	Same as pg_stat_all_tables, except that only user tables are shown.

pg_stat_xact_all_tables	Similar to pg_stat_all_tables, but counts actions taken so far within the current transaction (which are not yet included in pg_stat_all_tables and related views). The columns for numbers of live and dead rows and vacuum and analyze actions are not present in this view.

pg_stat_xact_sys_tables	Same as pg_stat_xact_all_tables, except that only system tables are shown.

pg_stat_xact_user_tables	Same as pg_stat_xact_all_tables, except that only user tables are shown.

pg_stat_all_indexes	For each index in the current database, the table and index OID, schema, table and index name, number of index scans initiated on that index, number of index entries returned by index scans, and number of live table rows fetched by simple index scans using that index.

pg_stat_sys_indexes	Same as pg_stat_all_indexes, except that only indexes on system tables are shown.

pg_stat_user_indexes	Same as pg_stat_all_indexes, except that only indexes on user tables are shown.

pg_statio_all_tables	For each table in the current database (including TOAST tables), the table OID, schema and table name, number of disk blocks read from that table, number of buffer hits, numbers of disk blocks read and buffer hits in all indexes of that table, numbers of disk blocks read and buffer hits from that table's auxiliary TOAST table (if any), and numbers of disk blocks read and buffer hits for the TOAST table's index.

pg_statio_sys_tables	Same as pg_statio_all_tables, except that only system tables are shown.

pg_statio_user_tables	Same as pg_statio_all_tables, except that only user tables are shown.

pg_statio_all_indexes	For each index in the current database, the table and index OID, schema, table and index name, numbers of disk blocks read and buffer hits in that index.

pg_statio_sys_indexes	Same as pg_statio_all_indexes, except that only indexes on system tables are shown.

pg_statio_user_indexes	Same as pg_statio_all_indexes, except that only indexes on user tables are shown.

pg_statio_all_sequences	For each sequence object in the current database, the sequence OID, schema and sequence name, numbers of disk blocks read and buffer hits in that sequence.

pg_statio_sys_sequences	Same as pg_statio_all_sequences, except that only system sequences are shown. (Presently, no system sequences are defined, so this view is always empty.)

pg_statio_user_sequences	Same as pg_statio_all_sequences, except that only user sequences are shown.

pg_stat_user_functions	For all tracked functions, function OID, schema, name, number of calls, total time, and self time. Self time is the amount of time spent in the function itself, total time includes the time spent in functions it called. Time values are in milliseconds.

pg_stat_xact_user_functions	Similar to pg_stat_user_functions, but counts only calls during the current transaction (which are not yet included in pg_stat_user_functions).
