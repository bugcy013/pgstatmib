pgstatUsrTables
===============

For each user table in the current database (including TOAST tables), the table OID, schema and table name, number of sequential scans initiated, number of live rows fetched by sequential scans, number of index scans initiated (over all indexes belonging to the table), number of live rows fetched by index scans, numbers of row insertions, updates, and deletions, number of row updates that were HOT (i.e., no separate index update), numbers of live and dead rows, the last time the table was non-FULL vacuumed manually, the last time it was vacuumed by the autovacuum daemon, the last time it was analyzed manually, the last time it was analyzed by the autovacuum daemon, number of times it has been non-FULL vacuumed manually, number of times it has been vacuumed by the autovacuum daemon, number of times it has been analyzed manually, and the number of times it has been analyzed by the autovacuum daemon.
